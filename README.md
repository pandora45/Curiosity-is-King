# Curiosity-is-King
This is a project dedicated to finding value from structured and unstructured sources

Code of Conduct: Be Nice! Please let all contributions not only be constructive but worded in a manner that encourages rather than discourages. Nothing foul or obscene. Thank You.

This project is useful because it chronicles the use of technology from the perspective of a data practitioner rather than a developer. Any developers will be able to take note of the tools and languages we use to extract data or observe the process of analysis and maybe able to innovate a more effective tool, process, or way of capturing conclusions to facilitate analysis and visualizations (charts).
